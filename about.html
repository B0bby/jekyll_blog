		<b>Why "Dumb"?</b><br>
		I feel like, in my field, I am constantly surrounded by incredibly talented people. This is both thrilling and enlightening, but as a result, I have a bit of an inferiority complex.<br><br>

		<b>Me</b><br>
		I'm not very good at self-promotion. I enjoy running, though I also like walking. I like drawing; I'm an okay graphic designer. I've always liked computers and things that have to do with computers. I enjoy learning, and I am often finding ways to refine my learning process, and I keep inordinately long, meticulous to-do lists.<br><br>
