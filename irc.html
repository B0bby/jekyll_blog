<h>The Elevator Pitch</h>
<div>
	Basically, if you want to communicate via text over the internet, there is no better way than Internet Relay Chat. It was one of the first, and it persists to this day not because of kitsch, but because it remains one of the most useful and adaptable forms of text communication available. Here's a little tutorial for helping you get started.

<h>The Tutorial</h>
<div>
	Rather than do a step-by-step tutorial for operating a particular IRC client, I'll just go over the basics, which can be applied to any IRC client ever.

<h2>Gettin' Connected</h2>
<div>
	So if you want to connect to a chat server on IRC, all you need are two pieces of information, the <b>Server</b> and the <b>Channel</b> (a <b>Nickname</b> is also crucial, but that can be whatever you want it to be, whenever you want it to be; no need for an account of any sort). The server information comes in the form of a url, typically preceded by 'irc'; for example, 'irc.freenode.net' or 'irc.quake.net'. The channel information is simply the name of the chat channel you want to connect to, preceded by a pound sign, like '#hamradio' or '#theusualsuspects'. If you join a chat channel that doesn't already exist, it makes one for you, with you as the main operator, easy as that.

<h2>Uh, or do This</h2>

	I found this thingy while I was researching IRC stuffs. This'll probably be even easier.
