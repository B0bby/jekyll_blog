HTML and CSS have always been things I'd like to know, but never really had a good enough excuse to learn. Recently I've been looking in to starting a blog, which seemed the perfect opportunity to give it a whirl and try to spin up my own site.

After purchasing the domain, I began considering where I should host the thing. The raspberry pi I use as a [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) server was a strong candidate , but I had been having trouble with downtime lately (I used a poorly-crimped cable to hook it up, that I haven't bothered to fix) so I began looking elsewhere. The sort-of-free [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/) option was another contender, however a friend of mine recently decided to end his AWS subscription, citing price as part of his overall dissatisfaction.

Days later, after reading the 'employee handbook' at my student job, I discovered that students had a web accessible directory in their university data storage account. This was a really bare-bones service, so I would be limited to static HTML pages if I wanted to host there. After mentioning it in IRC, another friend of mine suggested [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a sort of work-around, and after looking into it, I knew I had my project.

The rest is pretty much business as usual. The past couple days I've been reading, writing, testing, compiling, failing and compiling ad infinitum until stuff starts to sink in. [w3schools'](http://www.w3schools.com/) tutorials have been indispensible, as have [all of the github pages that host the source for their Jekyll-based sites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites). I started off using my own self-made style sheets, for learning purposes, but later began using the beautiful [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html), for the sake of everyone's eyes. Eventually, after finding out about Github Pages, I decided to forego my initial restriction of using my university data storage account. This granted me the much-needed excuse to "learn git better", as it's been written as a to-do on my whiteboard for weeks.

It's not much, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, and hope that it leads to similar learning experiences in the future, after finishing this site.

Test Versions:
v0.1 -- 'Bob's Kinda Shitty Website'
This is the first working version of the site I had up, using my own CSS. Hosted on my university data storage.
v0.5 -- 'Bob's Less Shitty Website'
Current version, using Twitter Bootstrap. Hosted on Github Pages
