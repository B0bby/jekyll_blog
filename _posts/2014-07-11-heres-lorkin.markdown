title: Here's Lorkin' at You
---

Like the classic adventure game it takes its name from, Lork was a CTF rolled into a text adventure. In Lork, you navigate a series of rooms containing obstacles that act as the challenges of this CTF. All players / teams advanced linerly through the same challenges. Death by Grue was often the penalty for incorrect answers, which required the player to restart the game from the first room. Most people, naturally, began to script their way back, for the sake of sanity; some even [shared their scripts to help others](https://twitter.com/exocron/status/484567691299012608).

As the game itself does a good job of introducing you to its mechanics -- with a little tough love -- I'll just go straight to the challenges.

## 1: Mr Fuzzing
For the first real challenge, you are faced with a locked door, and a keypad that asks for your name. 

> 'Mr. Fuzzing's name should be fuzzed, trimmed, and truncated!'
