I enjoy using <a href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> for notifications. It has a really slick, 
easy to use API. Currently, I have notifications from IRC pushed to my phone -- and I love it -- so 
I decided to look for a way to get similar notifications from my <i>other</i> major channel of text
communication, Skype.<br><br>
Some googling turned up the <a href="http://skype4py.sourceforge.net/doc/html/">skype4py</a> API, 
which made implementing a pushover notifier for Skype a snap, for the most part.<br><br>
One major stumbling block was that, while writing the script initially, I was testing it inside an 
Ubuntu 12.04 VM, which -- being Linux-based, of course -- runs an older version of Skype than the 
computer I intended to leave the script running on. <br><br>
The script works by cycling through every chat that the connected account is a part of, and grabbing 
the latest array of messages from each, then it enters a loop and cycles through each chat again, 
checking if the latest message has changed. If it detects a change, it checks the new message for 
commands or highlight words, does what it needs to, then grabs the latest message from every chat 
again and begins checking for new messages once more. <br><br>
<pre>
for chat in skype.Chats:
	if (messages[index] != "Null"):
		try:
			if (messages[index] != chat.RecentMessages[len(chat.RecentMessages) -1 ].Body):
				loop = False
				newMessage = skype.Chats[index].RecentMessages[len(skype.Chats[index].RecentMessages) -1]

</pre>
The problem I encountered involved the way that the messages were read from a chat. In the linux 
version of Skype, an empty chat will return one empty message in its message array, whereupon 
the program grabs the 'latest' message index by subtracting one from that array's length. In 
the latest Windows version, an empty chat will return an array of length zero, and subracting 
one from that will cause a runtime error. <br><br>
All I had to do was append an empty string in the case that a chat with zero messages appears, and 
I was good to go on both platforms.
<pre>
for chat in skype.Chats:
		if (len(chat.RecentMessages) <= 0):
			messages.append("Null")
		else:
			messages.append(chat.RecentMessages[len(chat.RecentMessages) -1 ].Body)
