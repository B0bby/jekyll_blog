					So I've gotten the idea to make my own blog-like thing. I know this doesn't look like much, but I have the feeling that this is the start of something beautiful. 
<br><br>
I've spent the last day or so trying to get the hang of HTML and CSS for the first time, and I've also been experimenting with Jekyll, a static HTML page-generating program. I'm starting to really like it, the more I get the hang of it. 
<br><br>
My n00b is showing, but I hope to perhaps document my progress towards some semblance of competence.
