<h3>
SPRING BREAK. My body is ready. 
</h3>
<h4>
07 March 2013
</h4>
<p> 
I am excited for break, as I see opportunity for self-improvement. I have a number of goals I'd like to accomplish while I'm off, and I'll document them here for posterity and my own personal motivation.
<br><br>
First, I'd like to finish Metasploit Unleashed. I set out to accomplish this at the beginning of the semester, and somewhere along the line I lost my motivation to complete it. I feel a perfect storm brewing, though. I'll be home with plenty of free time, I already have all the necessary VM's set up, and right now I really <i>want</i> to finish it and acquire that knowledge.
<br><br>
Second, I want to probably make a not as shitty-looking blog, probably employing non lazy-beginner techniques and tools to build it. I'm thinking I'll probably use Jekyll and twitter bootstrap. I'm applying a restriction to my design
<br><br>
Third, and relatively unrelated, but I need to commit myself more thoroughly to my studies, particularly in Accounting. So I'll be attempting to complete at least two accounting problems a day over break. Of all my goals, this is probably one of the most unattainable, but I've gotta shoot for the stars.
