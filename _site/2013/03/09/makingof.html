		HTML and CSS have always been things I'd <i>like</i> to know, but never really had a good enough excuse to learn. Recently I've been looking in to starting a blog, which seemed the perfect opportunity to give it a whirl and try to spin up my own site.<br><br>

After purchasing the domain, I began considering where I should host the thing. The raspberry pi I use as a <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> server was a strong candidate , but I had been having trouble with downtime lately (I used a poorly-crimped cable to hook it up, that I haven't bothered to fix) so I began looking elsewhere. The sort-of-free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Service</a> option was another contender, however a friend of mine recently decided to end his AWS subscription, citing price as part of his overall dissatisfaction.<br><br>

Days later, after reading the 'employee handbook' at my student job, I discovered that students had a web accessible directory in their university data storage account. This was a really bare-bones service, so I would be limited to static HTML pages if I wanted to host there. After mentioning it in IRC, another friend of mine suggested <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as a sort of work-around, and after looking into it, I knew I had my project.<br><br>

The rest is pretty much business as usual. The past couple days I've been reading, writing, testing, compiling, failing and compiling ad infinitum until stuff starts to sink in. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools'</a> tutorials have been indispensible, as have <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites">all of the github pages that host the source for their Jekyll-based sites</a>. I started off using my own self-made style sheets, for learning purposes, but later began using the beautiful <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, for the sake of everyone's eyes. Eventually, after finding out about Github Pages, I decided to forego my initial restriction of using my university data storage account. This granted me the much-needed excuse to "learn git better", as it's been written as a to-do on my whiteboard for weeks.<br><br>

It's not much, but I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, and hope that it leads to similar learning experiences in the future, after finishing this site.<br><br>

Test Versions:<br>
<br><em>v0.1 -- 'Bob's Kinda Shitty Website'</em>
<br>This is the first working version of the site I had up, using my own CSS. Hosted on my university data storage.
<br><em>v0.5 -- 'Bob's <i>Less</i> Shitty Website'</em>
<br>Current version, using Twitter Bootstrap. Hosted on Github Pages
