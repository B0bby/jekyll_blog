		So here's something that's been on my mind the past couple of days. This is in light of an event that seemed innocuous enough at first, but whose implications have been gnawing at me for days. In here, I will document the rationalization the put my mind at ease.<br><br>

I am very fortunate for the friends I have, all of whom are great people, and very supportive of eachother and myself. Of particular note to some of my longest-kept friendships (pre-college, to be more precise), most do not share their most passionate interests, neither among themselves nor with me.<br><br>

Except for one.<br><br>

Together we maintain a mutual thirst for knowledge related to computer hardware and software; we are fascinated by it.  When collaborating, we posses great synergy. However, what happens when we work independently is what has been bothering me lately.<br><br>

I am speaking strictly for myself here, I do not know if my friend shares a similar outlook, but when I see this friend making great strides, independently, related to our shared 'quest for knowledge' -- so to speak -- I can't help but feel mildly threatened. I percieved this as unfriendly behavior, however insignificant the feeling was compared to my genuine enthusiasm, which metastacized into the murky thoughts that began to fuddle my mood. The threat I felt -- I eventually decided after some consideration -- most definitely does not reflect negatively on our friendship in any way.<br><br>

Having good friends that share close interests is important for personal development. A friendly rival, one that is very close in skill to onesself, is an excellent way to spur progress towards a goal. Weather the threat is experienced mutually or not, both parties benefit from an increased pressure to perform, without the complete dissatisfaction of losing when you come up short because, hey, you can always ask your friend for help!
